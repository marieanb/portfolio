        <h2>Qualitative Research</h2>
        <p>
            My roles in the project: UX researcher, interviewer, poster designer. <br><br>
            Together with a fellow student, we conducted a qualitative research project on <b>user expectations
            and concerns regarding smart gym
            equipment</b> for the <b>Advanced HCI Qualitative Research Conference</b> at Utrecht University.
            <br><br>Our work earned the <b>Best Poster Award</b>, confirming the quality and depth of our research.

            <br><br>
            <b>Reflection</b><br>
            
            This project taught me how to conduct in-depth user research and present findings in a clear, 
            engaging way. A challenge we faced was getting participants to openly share their thoughts. 
            We tackled this by using open-ended questions and creating a comfortable interview setting. 
            Winning the Best Poster Award was a rewarding recognition of our work.
