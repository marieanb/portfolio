        <h2>Computer Animation Movie Project</h2>
        My roles in the project: Shogun live, scene building, metahuman creation, Blender and Unity editing,
        choreography, creative direction, acting. <br><br>
        <p> During my studies I had the opportunity to choose an extracurricular <b>Computer Animation</b> course from Game and Media Technology program.
            During the course I did a fun project together with three fellow students
            at the <b>Motion Capture and Virtual Reality Lab</b>.<br><br>

            Together we created an animated movie with a storyline of characters playing different video games in their living room.
            At the end of the course we got a chance to present our movie at the courses' Film Festival to an audience.
            <br>The presented snippet is a fun choreography that movie characters do while playing a dance game.
            <br><br>

            <b>Software</b>
            <ul>
                <li>The <b>Vicon Shogun</b> software was used for motion capture to bring the characters to life.</li>
                <li>The animated characters were sourced from <b>Mixamo</b> and designed with <b>Unreal Engine Metahuman</b>.</li>
                <li>Different parts of the movie were edited and assembled using <b>Unreal Engine, Blender</b>, and <b>Unity</b>.</li>
            </ul>
        <br><br>
        <b>Reflection</b><br>
        This project taught me how to use animation tools like Vicon Shogun and MoCap to 
        create and animate characters. One challenge was getting the dance moves to sync up correctly, 
        which was solved by adjusting the timing in Blender. Presenting our work at a film festival was a great 
        way to end the project and see the audienceâ€™s reaction.
