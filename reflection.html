        <h2><b>Study Plan Reflection</b></h2>
        <p>
            My study plan in Human-Computer Interaction has been a really well-adapted choice of design, technology,
            and psychology, which has strengthened my approach as a UX designer focused on smart, user-centered technology.
            Courses like Adaptive Interactive Systems and Technologies for Learning taught me how to create designs that
            intelligently adapt to users' needs, making my work more responsive and personalized. This directly supports my
            goal of designing tech that engages users in meaningful ways.<br><br>

            Information Visualization helped me learn how to take complex information and present it in a clear, simple way,
            which is valuable for UX and especially for interactive art—an area I’m really passionate about.
            I love how it allows me to turn data into something visually engaging, making it easier for users to understand and
            connect with.<br><br>

            Multimodal Interaction and Mobile Interaction gave me a deeper understanding of how users interact with technology
            from a technical angle. These courses really broadened my view of what shapes user behavior, which is key when designing
            experiences that feel intuitive and natural. Learning about these aspects has been eye-opening in seeing how technical
            factors influence user emotions and actions.<br><br>

            Finally, Computer Animation was especially engaging, connecting my interest in human motion with art direction.
            My experience as a dancer really helped me here, as I explored how animation can bring digital interactions to life
            in a way that feels dynamic and human. This mix of technical knowledge and creative expression inspires me to create
            designs that blend art, motion, and technology in user-centered ways.

        <h2><b>Thesis Project Description</b></h2>
        <p>I am working on my thesis project together with a dance company. The project explores the concept of "experience" within XR (Extended Reality),
            focusing on creating an immersive environment for children. The goal is to develop
            two VR/XR prototypes that encourage groups of 2 to 16 children to explore and move within a virtual space.
            Additionally, a technical feasibility study will assess how these XR experiences could be implemented in
            schools and other locations.<br><br>

            The final desired outcome is an XR prototype that enhances a stage performance, allowing children to
            interact using an OptiTrack system and a Unity-based setup with multiple levels. This project seeks to
            expand the traditional theater experience through XR, creating new ways for young audiences to engage and explore.</p>
        <h2><b>Future Plans</b></h2>
        <p>In the future, I’m excited to dive deeper into UI/UX, VR, and Motion
            Capture through freelance projects that let me collaborate with creative environments
            like theaters, museums, and other cultural spaces. I’m drawn to the idea of blending
            technology and art to create interactive, immersive experiences that engage audiences in new ways.
            Working with these spaces would allow me to push the boundaries of user experience design while bringing
            innovative, tech-driven storytelling to life.</p>
