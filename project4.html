        <h2>Investigating the Impact of  Scent on Visual Attention and Memory</h2>
        <p>
            My roles in the project: experimental researcher, data analyst.<br><br>

            <b>The research focused on two key questions</b><br>
            RQ1 – Do participants exposed to a scent during a learning task recall more words related to that
            scent than words not related to the scent?<br>
            RQ2 – Do participants spend more time looking at words associated with the scent and do they look
            at them more frequently?<br><br>

            The project started with a pre-study to identify the appropriate scent
            (a citrus car air freshener), followed by a pilot study to refine the workflow (see fig. 3). Finally, the main study was
            conducted to collect data.<br>

            Participants were asked to memorize words related to the citrus scent from a word cloud<br> (see fig. 1 and fig. 2).<br><br>

            The <b>Eye-tracking Technology</b> (see fig. 1) was used
            to measure participants' focus of attention and duration of gaze on certain words, along with a <b>Verbal
            Learning Test</b> to track
            how many and which words were recalled.

            <br><br><b>Result</b><br>
            Participants exposed to lemon scent during a verbal learning task recall more words associated with this scent,
            as compared to participants not exposed to an olfactory stimulus, however, the impact of scent on memory might
            not be immediate.

            <br><br>
            <b>Reflection</b>
            This project taught me how to design and analyze experiments to understand how scent affects memory and attention.
            Main challenge was figuring out the eye-tracking software and data, as small errors could affect results; 
            We spent extra hours in the lab to make sure the setup is right. 
            The experience improved my skills in experimental research and data analysis.
